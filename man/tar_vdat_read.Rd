\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target. A target
name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{\link[targets:tar_seed_set]{tar_seed_set()}}
on the result to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{vdat_dirs}{Nonempty character vector of known existing directories of
VDAT files to track for changes.}

\item{csv_outdir}{file path to the output directory}

\item{batch_size}{Positive integer of length 1, number of files to partition
into a batch. The default is ten files per batch.}

\item{batches}{Positive integer of length 1, number of batches
to partition the files. The default is one file per batch
(maximum number of batches) which is simplest to handle but
could cause a lot of overhead and consume a lot of computing resources.
Consider reducing the number of batches below the number of files
for heavy workloads.}

\item{format}{Character, either \code{"file"}, \code{"file_fast"}, or \code{"url"}.
See the \code{format} argument of \code{targets::tar_target()} for details.}

\item{repository}{Character of length 1, remote repository for target
storage. Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"local"}: file system of the local machine.
\item \code{"aws"}: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. Can be configured
with a non-AWS S3 bucket using the \code{endpoint} argument of
\code{\link[targets:tar_resources_aws]{tar_resources_aws()}}, but versioning capabilities may be lost
in doing so.
See the cloud storage section of
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html}
for details for instructions.
\item \code{"gcp"}: Google Cloud Platform storage bucket.
See the cloud storage section of
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html}
for details for instructions.
}

Note: if \code{repository} is not \code{"local"} and \code{format} is \code{"file"}
then the target should create a single output file.
That output file is uploaded to the cloud and tracked for changes
where it exists in the cloud. The local file is deleted after
the target runs.}

\item{iteration}{Character, iteration method. Must be a method
supported by the \code{iteration} argument of \code{targets::tar_target()}.
The iteration method for the upstream target is always \code{"list"}
in order to support batching.}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
stops and throws an error. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"stop"}: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.
\item \code{"continue"}: the whole pipeline keeps going.
\item \code{"abridge"}: any currently running targets keep running,
but no new targets launch after that.
(Visit \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html}
to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)
\item \code{"null"}: The errored target continues and returns \code{NULL}.
The data hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not
up to date for the next run of the pipeline.
}}

\item{memory}{Character of length 1, memory strategy.
If \code{"persistent"}, the target stays in memory
until the end of the pipeline (unless \code{storage} is \code{"worker"},
in which case \code{targets} unloads the value from memory
right after storing it in order to avoid sending
copious data over a network).
If \code{"transient"}, the target gets unloaded
after every new target completes.
Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
whenever another target needs the value.
For cloud-based dynamic files
(e.g. \code{format = "file"} with \code{repository = "aws"}),
this memory strategy applies to the
temporary local copy of the file:
\code{"persistent"} means it remains until the end of the pipeline
and is then deleted,
and \code{"transient"} means it gets deleted as soon as possible.
The former conserves bandwidth,
and the latter conserves local storage.}

\item{garbage_collection}{Logical, whether to run \code{base::gc()}
just before the target runs.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get dispatched earlier
(and polled earlier in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}).}

\item{resources}{Object returned by \code{tar_resources()}
with optional settings for high-performance computing
functionality, alternative data storage formats,
and other optional capabilities of \code{targets}.
See \code{tar_resources()} for details.}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()}
to customize the rules that decide whether the target is up to date.
Only applies to the downstream target. The upstream target always runs.}
