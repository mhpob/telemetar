This package aims to provide
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) archetypes for analysis
of fish acoustic telemetry data *a la* the
[`tarchetypes`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/) package. The
eventual hope is to play nicely with, or even become a part of, the [R
Targetopia](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/); if you’d like to
contribute please follow the [Targetopia development
guidelines](https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html).

Like the package, the name is a work in progress: [vote for your
favorite or suggest another name
here](https://github.com/mhpob/telemetar/discussions/2)! Some
candidates:

- `telemetar` (current)
- `sharketypes`
- ~~`egrets`~~ (taken)
- `trackytypes`
- `trackets`
