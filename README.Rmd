<!-- badges: end -->

This package aims to provide [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) archetypes for analysis of fish acoustic telemetry data *a la* the [`tarchetypes`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/) package.

Like the package, the name is a work in progress: [vote for your favorite or suggest another name here](https://github.com/mhpob/telemetar/discussions/2)! Some candidates:

-   `telemetar` (current)
-   `sharketypes`
-   ~~`egrets`~~ (taken)
-   `trackytypes`
-   `trackets`
